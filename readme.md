## Tasks:

###### 1) Fill the gaps.

Fill in the gaps to make an application write data to console: fill the gaps to print "Fixed" to console with a new
line.
Use code snippet provided here (each word should begin with a new line):

    public class FillGapsApp {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
                  .           ("Fixed");
        }
    }

##### 2) Print words.

Make console output like: "java" + \n "is" + \n +"smth". Create java program that will write to console:
java
is
smth

For that use the following code snippet (each word should begin with a new line):

    public class PrintWordsApp {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            //write your code here
        }
    }

#### 3) Print sentence.

Create main method and make console output: "This is my first Java program". Create java program that will write to
console:
This is my first Java program

For that use the following code snippet:

    public class PrintSentenceApp {
    }

#### 4) Broken app.

Given piece of code (not compiling one), fill everything that is missing for the program and compile and build it.
Do that inside of a code snippet here (each word should begin with a new line):

    public class BrokenApp {
        public main(String args) {
            System.out,println("fixMe)
        }
    }

#### 5) Update class.

Update this class to make an output:

"I'm updated  
can be compiled. And can write to console"

    public class UpdatedApp {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            System.out.println("fixMe");
        }
    }
